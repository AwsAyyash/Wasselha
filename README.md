# Wasselha

Wasselha is an Android mobile app called Wasselha (Deliver it) that supports both Arabic and English languages, It offers a consumer-to-consumer marketplace helping customers find a delivery service for their packages, and request these services from the transporters (the service providers). In addition to a nice feature, the collection points are used as places to hand over and collect packages (provided by the collection point providers).

The app was developed with Java as a native Android app following the MVC design pattern, Django-Python restful APIs backend server with ORM SQLite3 database.
I was a part of a team with my colleagues Ghassan and Salah.
